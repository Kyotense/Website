#Setup and Getting Started

There are a few steps we need to take to get this website up and running.

The first thing that needs to happen is the installition of the dependencies of the project. This project makes use of Virtual Env.
``` bash
  virtualenv VirtualEnvironment
  source VirtualEnvironemnt/bin/activate
  
  # now to install the python dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Everytime you want to use the server you must activate the environment.

Now lets get the database setup for the website and generate some fake data.
