This README explains the reason for the reason for this website. We wanted to make a website that uses a shopping cart, and a server to pull products for the website. We didn’t want to take any chances of infringement, so the contents listed on this website is fake. There is no way we will store any credit card information, or any payment information for that matter. Suffice to say, there is nothing on this website that is real. If there is any resemblance to any product it is just a coincidence, or not related.
